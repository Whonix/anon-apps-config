## KGPG settings

[GPG Settings]
## Pre-configured first time wizard.
gpg_config_path[$e]=$HOME/.gnupg/gpg.conf
## Pre-configured GPG v2 as default.
gpg_bin_path[$e]=gpg2

## Pre-configured first time wizard.
[General Options]
First run=false

## Added hkp://qdigse2yzvuglcix.onion to the default list.
## Same as in:
## -- https://raw.github.com/ioerror/torbirdy/master/gpg.conf
## -- https://github.com/ioerror/torbirdy/commit/e6d7c9e6e103f0b3289675d04ed3f92e92d8d7b3
## -- whonix_workstation/usr/share/whonix/home/.gnupg/gpg.conf
[Servers]
Server_List=hkp://qdigse2yzvuglcix.onion,hkp://wwwkeys.pgp.net,hkp://pgp.dtype.org,hkp://search.keyserver.net,hkp://subkeys.pgp.net,hkp://wwwkeys.pgp.net,hkp://wwwkeys.us.pgp.net

## Disabled tip of the day.
[TipOfDay]
RunOnStart=false

## Disabled tray icon, because KDE minimized KGpg into the tray area by
## default and also hides its tray icon by default. This is very confusing for
## users. Therefore we start KGpg in foreground without tray icon. Users are
## free to change this setting.
[User Interface]
systray_icon=false
